TEC-1 programmable avalanche pulse generator

Danger HV

Combine the programmability of a Z80 single-board computer (SBC) with an avalanche transistor circuit to generate adjustable high-voltage pulses, ideal for pulse electronics experiments and retro-tech applications. By integrating optocouplers for safety and utilizing the Z80's CTC timers for precise control, this setup enables dynamic pulse shaping with software-driven adjustments. Rigorous oscilloscope testing ensures reliability, making it a powerful tool for exploring high-speed switching and transient phenomena. ⚡

There's more and more requirement for fast rise time pulse generator especially with high repetition frequency and high voltage. A cost effective and portable high-repetition high voltage nanosecond rectangular pulse generator is developed in this paper using serial avalanche transistors. By carefully designing the serial transistor circuit and PCB, the stray inductance and voltage reflection are reduced effectively, which make the output rectangular pulse obtain 2.5 ns rise time. The amplitude output pulse can reach up to 2.5 kV with 12.5 ns width. The pulse time jitter is less than 100 ps even in10 kHz high repetition frequency output mode.
