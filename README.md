TEC-1 programmable avalanche pulse generator

Danger HV

Combine the programmability of a Z80 single-board computer (SBC) with an avalanche transistor circuit to generate adjustable high-voltage pulses, ideal for pulse electronics experiments and retro-tech applications. By integrating optocouplers for safety and utilizing the Z80's CTC timers for precise control, this setup enables dynamic pulse shaping with software-driven adjustments. Rigorous oscilloscope testing ensures reliability, making it a powerful tool for exploring high-speed switching and transient phenomena. âš¡
